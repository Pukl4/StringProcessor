# StringProcessor
## Description:

TODO

## Task requirements:

### Write a console application that support the following functionality:
- reverse a given string without respecting the order of the words in a sentence (without leveraging any out-of-the-box C# methods).
- same as previous, but with respect to the order of the words.
- remove a given set of forbidden characters from a given string.
- calculate how many times each character is used in a given string.

A user should be able to select the application feature they want to use on each request to the console app. The application should implement infinite retries and only exist when the user chooses to. The application should also implement user input validation. The application should write the results into a text file based on the file path of your choosing.
